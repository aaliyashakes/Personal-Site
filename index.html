            <h3>C/C++</h3>
            <p>I learnt C++ when I was in higher secondary school. I had Computer Science subject and C++ was a part of the subject. I learnt about Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures. I even created a game, Tic-tac-toe using C++ programming language for my project. So, C++ is my first main programming language in which I built my command.</p>

            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>I acquired knowledge in HTML when I was in 9th. I always found programming interesting and I had a good grip in it. My School friends used to take my help while writing HTML Codes. At that time, I did it in Notepad but now here I am using it professionally in amazing text editors such as VS Code. </p>

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>I started learning CSS when I decided to build my skills in Web Development. I want to build stylized websites for my clients and with the help of CSS, I can fulfill this requirement. I love to play with font styles, background-colours and images-format while coding in CSS. HTML and CSS are my beginning steps in this journey of Web Development.</p>

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>I leant Python via an online course on Coursera. I wanted to grab my command in this programming language to see what is so different about it than than C/C++. I later on did an internship in Python to learn more about it. The commands in Python are much easier to process than in C++. But they both have their own importance.</p>

            <h3>Microsoft Office</h3>
            <p>I have been using Microsoft Office Applications since primary school. I used to write mails/essays in MS Word, create intriguing presentations on PowerPoint. I learnt MS Excel in Primary School as well to create data in tabular form. I like MS Office Applications for providing significant services to the users and make the office work easy for them.</p>
